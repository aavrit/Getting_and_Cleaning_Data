Description of Variables in the cleaned data "tidyData"
 
 Originally, the combined training and test data set has 563 variables and over 10,000 (10299) observations.
 After cleaning and extracting the required variables, it has a condensed form of 88 Variables and 180 observations. 
 
1. The 88 Variables are:
    Columns No 1 though 86 are mean and standard deviations of various movements the subjects performed.
    Column No 87 called "Activity" : Six different activities (Laying, Sitting, Walking, Walking_Downstairs, Walking_Upstairs)
    Column No 88 called "Subject" : the identification number 1 through 30 of the test subjects
	
2. The raw data was:

    "X_test.txt", "y_test.txt", "subject_test.txt" (feature vectors, activities, id) describes the measurements, features, and subject id of the test set.
    "X_train.txt", "y_train.txt", "subject_train.txt" (feature vectors, activities, id) describes the measurements, features, and subject id of the training set.
    The subject id, measurements, and activity features of the test and training set were first combined using rbind;
	The complete dataset was formed using cbind of the rbind subject id, measurement, and activity feature data.
	
3.	Then, measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement were extracted from the complete dataset. 
	Descriptive activity names were applied to the activities in the condensed data set
	More readable descriptive variable names were applied to the 86 mean and std variables.
	
4.	Use the write.table() command to convert the cleaned data into an independent dataset in text file ("Tidy.txt").
